LED ROM project
+ have been meaning to work on this at least since 2012 or so
+ bought a huge roll of Red LEDs in prep
+ Originally thought maybe I could map it as an SPI ROM or something,
  but an Atari 2600 ROM would be more fun

Issues:
+ LED voltage drop of 1.6V much higher than diode of 0.6V which means
	extra work needed when using LEDs
+ Lighting LEDs bright enough might need transistors to pull up
+ Will the 5V supply provide enough current?


Parts to consider:
	74LS138 3->8 decoder popular
	74HCT154 4->16 decoder, need fewer, bigger chip

Diode Matrix ROM for Atari 2600 (June 2014)
+ https://forums.atariage.com/topic/226940-diode-matrix-rom-for-atari-2600/
+ 64 byte
	no schematic

	1N60 diodes
	8 X 3.3K ohm pullup resistors
	.1 uf decoupling caps for each IC
	2 X 74AS04 inverters
	2 X 74HC244 buffers
	9 X 74LS138 3:8 decoders
	inverters used to reduce diode count (more 0s than 1s)

	3.3k pullup
	lots of diodes
	schematic included
	A12 = chip select?
