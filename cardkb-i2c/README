This is code for reading the CardKB i2c keboard from m5stack

https://docs.m5stack.com/en/unit/cardkb_1.1

Note the yellow wire is SDA and thw white wire is SCL



How it works:
	Has 1 byte buffer.  Returns most recent keypress.
	Once read, returns 0.

	Have to constantly poll to know if keypress available.

Keys:
	by default lowercase letters, numbers
		backspace, enter (carriage return) and escape
		arrows are B4 B5 B6 B7 (L U D R)
	symbol modifier gets you punctuation
	shift modifier gets you upper case letters
		numbers same.  backspace turns to delete
	function modifier weird.  Sets high bit and it's based on
		keyboard layout not underlying ASCII code.
		Top row 0x80...0xAF on bottom
