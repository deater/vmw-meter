This is code for reading the CardKB i2c keboard from m5stack

https://docs.m5stack.com/en/unit/cardkb_1.1

Note the yellow wire is SDA and thw white wire is SCL



How it works:
	Has 1 byte buffer.  Returns most recent keypress.
	Once read, returns 0.

	Have to constantly poll to know if keypress available.
